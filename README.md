## Natural Language Processing Techniques: Bitcoin and Ethereum

In this assignment, fundamental natural language processing techniques from the NLTK library were applied to the latest news articles from [newsapi](https://newsapi.org/) featuring Bitcoin and Ethereum.  A number of factors were analyzed including, sentiment, common words, phrases, organizations, and entities mentioned in aticles.  

1. [Sentiment Analysis](#Sentiment-Analysis)
2. [Natural Language Processing](#Natural-Language-Processing)
3. [Named Entity Recognition](#Named-Entity-Recognition)


### News Sentiment

Sentiment analysis is a process to determine emotional tone within a text, providing insights into attitudes or opinions. For this analysis, `SentimentIntensityAnalyzer` was imported from NLTK.Sentiment.Vader library. 

The API key environment variable was read in and used to create a newsapi client that fetched in news articles with `.get_everything()` using key words Bitcoin and Ethereum. There were 4321 results returned for Bitcoin and 900 for Ethereum. The title and content were extracted from each result and saved in respective DataFrames. The newsapi does truncate the content of each article to 260 characters.  
Sentiment scores were generated by applying `sentiment = analyzer.polarity_scores(text)` and `analyzer.polarity_scores()` on the content for each article.

The results were summarized `.describe()`

Summary of results: Bitcoin and Ethereum had similar mean positive scores, Bitcoin marginally higher. Bitcoin had the highest mean compound score, but Ethereum had the highest maximum compound score as well as the highest maximum positive score. Results overall were fairly similar with both showing low negative scores and sentiment primarily neutral. 


### Tokenizer

from nltk.corpus import reuters, stopwords


from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize, sent_tokenize
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer, PorterStemmer
from string import punctuation
import re


### NGrams and Frequency Analysis

from collections import Counter
from nltk import ngrams

In this section you will look at the ngrams and word frequency for each coin. 

1. Use NLTK to produce the n-grams for N = 2. 
2. List the top 10 words for each coin. 


# Word Clouds

In this section, you will generate word clouds for each coin to summarize the news for each coin


# Named Entity Recognition

In this section, you will build a named entity recognition model for both coins and visualize the tags using SpaCy.
